    <h3>Meet the Woman Behind the Scenes</h3>
    <p>Hello and welcome to S.O.S! My name is Sydney and I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying communcations and media, with a minor in entrepreneurship! I have been organizing, color coding, and putting things in thei place ever since I was 4 years old (according to my mother). My sisters would pay me to clean theur rooms, my aunt would have me come over to declutter her closet, and I would recieve phone calls from local neighbors to come organize their pantries. It is safe to say that I have an eye for all things organization! My end goal is to one day have my own home organization bysiness! In the  meantime, while I finish up college I do home organization on the side for people living locally in the Ann Arbor area. Clearing clutter, visualizing a space, making the space visually appealing and functional is my passion. I would love to help you make all of your organization dreams come true! </p>
    <p>With Love, Sydney Vigo S.O.S. </p>
