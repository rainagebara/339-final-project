    <h1>Some of My Favorite Tips and Ticks Leading to an Organized Life</h1>
    <h2>Pantry</h2>
    <p>Turntables. I rely heavily on turntables for not only pantries but for medicine cabinets, shelves, and spices. They provide simplicity and better use of space.</p>
    <h2>Closets</h2>
    <p>When organizing your clothes in your closet do not do it by color, do it by item and then within that item color code. This allows you to find what you are looking for faster but also keeps your closet clean, functional, and organized</p>
    <p>Clear hangers. Look cleaner, take up less space, and are easier to use. Throw away your plastic hangers!</p>
    <p>Every 3-6 months go through your closet and if you have not worn the item within that time period, say goodbye! This will hold you accountrable to living your life less overwhelmed and feeling cluttered!</p>
    <h2>Play Rooms</h2>
    <p>Simple living. Less is always more when it comes to organizing and revamping your spaces</p>
    <h2>Home</h2>
    <p>Funcationality over ascetically pleasing. Make sure when you are organizing a space you are doing it based on what makes the most sense for YOU and YOUR life. Then, make it pretty in your own way</p>
    <p>Use labels. However, do not make the labels too specific. Having specific labels make it such that new items do not always have a home, creating more clutter, and in a sense creating even greater disorder. Bottom line , kepp the labels broad.</p>
